# Casino Simulation Platform

A React-based casino platform simulation project, featuring casino games, promotions, and news. Built with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and React hooks.

## Features

- **Casino Games**
  - Grid display of casino games with images, titles, and providers.
  - Client-side search and category filters (`slots`, `live-casino`, `table-games`, `jackpot`).
  - Real-time filtering as the user types or selects categories.

- **Promotions**
  - List of promotion cards with title and snippet.
  - Expandable "Read More" to view full terms.

- **News**
  - List of news articles with title and date.
  - Expandable "Read Article" to view full content.

- **Reusable Components**
  - Modular design: atoms, molecules, and organisms.
  - Header, navigation, cards, and search input components.

- **Custom Hook**
  - `useCasinoContent` for fetching and managing casino content.
  - Handles loading and error states gracefully.

## Technologies

- React 18
- TypeScript

npm start â€” Run the app in development mode.

npm build â€” Build the app for production.

npm test â€” Run Jest tests in watch mode.

## Design Choices & Project Structure

I structured this casino app to be **modular**, separating components by functionality using the **Atomic Design** methodology:

- **Atoms:** Basic, reusable UI elements such as buttons, inputs, and cards.
- **Molecules:** Groups of atoms forming more complex components, e.g., headers, news cards, promotion cards.
- **Organisms:** Larger sections that combine molecules and atoms, like the Casino Games grid, Promotions list, and News list.

This approach makes the app **modular, reusable, and easy to maintain**, which is especially helpful for dynamic content and interactive features like search, filtering, and expandable cards.

### Constants & Configuration

I created a separate file for constants (`utils/constants.ts`) to store values that **should not change often**, such as:

- API endpoints (e.g., `CASINO_CONTENT_ENDPOINT`)
- Menu sections (e.g., `"games"`, `"promotions"`, `"news"`)

Separating these constants makes the code **cleaner, easier to update, and more maintainable**.

npm lint â€” Run ESLint for code quality checks.
